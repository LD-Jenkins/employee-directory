# Employee Directory App

Employee directory app using React and data from the Random User API.

# Project Description

This is a simple directory app that displays user data in a table including first name, last name, phone and email of 20 random users. There is a text box to type in to filter the data and the first and last name column headers are clickable to sort in either ascending or descending order.

# Setup/Installation

## Local

First start by making sure all project files have been downloaded and dependencies installed. Everything should work out of the box without additional setup. Simply run the start script and a new tab in your default browser should open.
